### Set up
 - this will enable you to install all the required libraries for the application
```shell
  $ npm install
```

### start server locally
 - this will enable you view the project interface on port 1234, ensure no other server is running on that port
```shell
  $ npm run dev
```

### build project for production
 - this will compile your project essentials to one directory (dist) that you can copy to you production server
```shell
  $ npm run build
```

### ignore unecesary files for versioning
 - in case there are additional files that don't need to be versioned by git, add them to the .gitignore file

## happy coding!
